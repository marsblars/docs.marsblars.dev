Hey everyone! I'm Marselo, a tech and fitness enthusiast. I am currently a college student at MJC pursuing a transfer degree in Computer Science.
My current areas of interest include web development, game development, artificial intelligence, self-hosting, virtual machines and docker. I believe in constantly improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies in these fields.

In my free time, I love to spend time with my dog, Canela.

I am also passionate about playing music and working out. I enjoy exploring new ideas and finding creative solutions to problems.

I am eager to continue my education and find opportunities to put my skills to use in real-world projects. I am confident in my ability to collaborate effectively with others and deliver high-quality results.

Feel free to reach out to me at contact@marsblars.dev, or connect with me on my posted profiles.

Thanks for visiting my about me page!
