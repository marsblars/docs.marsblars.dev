# Mounting a Google Drive Cloud Storage Drive Using Rclone with Docker Volumes

## Introduction

In the era of cloud-based infrastructure, Docker has become a vital tool for developers to create, deploy, and manage applications. One of the key features of Docker is its ability to create and manage data volumes that persist even after the containers are destroyed or recreated.

Mounting a Google Drive cloud storage drive using rclone with Docker volumes offers several benefits, including data persistence, scalability, security, and efficiency. Rclone is a command-line tool that helps users manage data on various cloud storage providers, including Google Drive. Rclone offers several features such as data synchronization, encryption, and bandwidth throttling.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Here are the step-by-step instructions to create a Docker volume for mounting a Google Drive cloud storage drive using rclone on Docker and Docker Compose:

### Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose

[Install Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.marsblars.dev/posts/docker-compose-pi4/) on your system. You can also follow the instructions on the Docker website to install both.

### Step 2: Install rclone and Rclone Docker Volume Plugin

```bash
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash 
```
The Rclone Docker Volume Plugin can be installed using this [guide](https://rclone.org/docker).

### Step 3: Configure rclone for Google Drive

Configure rclone to access your Google Drive cloud storage drive by following these instructions on the [rclone website](https://rclone.org/drive/).

### Step 4: add the following to the end of your docker coompose file to create the Docker volume

```yml
volumes:
  data:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: 'remote:data'
      allow_other: 'true'
      dir_cache_time: 72h
      drive_chunk_size: 64M
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      vfs_cache_max_age: 1h
      vfs_read_chunk_size: 32M
      vfs_read_chunk_size_limit: 'off'
      poll_interval: 0
```

### Step 5: Mount the Docker Volume to Other Containers

Mount the Docker volume by including the following line in your container's Docker Compose file:

```yml
    volumes:
      - data:/data
```


## Conclusion
Creating a Docker volume for mounting a Google Drive cloud storage drive using rclone on Docker and Docker Compose is simple and effective. With the help of Docker volumes, you can manage data in a scalable and efficient manner. By following the above steps and using the sample Docker Compose file provided, you can easily create a Docker volume for your Google Drive cloud storage drive using rclone.
