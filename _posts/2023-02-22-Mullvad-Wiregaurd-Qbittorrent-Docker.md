## Capabilities of Mullvad VPN with WireGuard and Qbittorrent on Docker and Docker Compose

Mullvad VPN can be used in conjunction with WireGuard, an open-source VPN protocol, and Qbittorrent, a popular BitTorrent client, on Docker and Docker Compose. This setup allows users to:

1. Protect their privacy and security while downloading files using BitTorrent.

2. Keep their online activities anonymous by encrypting their internet traffic and hiding their IP address.

3. Ensure fast and reliable connection speeds.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting up Mullvad VPN with WireGuard and Qbittorrent on Docker and Docker Compose

To set up Mullvad VPN with WireGuard and Qbittorrent on Docker and Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. [Install Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.marsblars.dev/posts/docker-compose-pi4/) on your computer.

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line.

3. Create a new file called "docker-compose.yml" and paste the following code into it:
```yml
---
version: "3"

services:
  qbittorrent:
    container_name: cbittorrent
    image: cr.hotio.dev/hotio/qbittorrent
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 8118:8118  #Change to Mullvad device's port forwarded port
    devices:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - UMASK=002
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles
      - VPN_ENABLED=true
      - VPN_LAN_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/24
      - VPN_CONF=wg0
      - VPN_ADDITIONAL_PORTS
      - PRIVOXY_ENABLED=false
    volumes:
      - /home/tv/cbittorrent:/config
      # - /home/tv/gdrive:/torrents
      # - /mnt/merge/tmp:/torrents.
     # - /home/tv/mnt:/drive
      - data:/data
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
      - net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
```

4. Create a new directory in your qbittorrent config directory called **wireguard**

5. Create a new file called **wg0.conf** inside the **wireguard** directory and paste the config provided by mullvad when creating a wiregaurd config:
```txt
[Interface]
PrivateKey = 
Address = 
DNS = 

[Peer]
PublicKey = 
AllowedIPs = 
Endpoint = 
```   

1. Start the Qbittorrent container by running the following command in the same directory as the "docker-compose.yml" file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

>This will start the containers in detached mode.

7. Verify that the containers are running by running the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

>This should display a list of running containers.

1. Open the Qbittorrent web interface by navigating to `http://<your IP address>:8080` in a web browser.

2. In the Qbittorrent settings, set the download and upload speed limits to your desired values.

3.  Start downloading files using Qbittorrent.

Congratulations! You have now set up Mullvad VPN with WireGuard and Qbittorrent on Docker and Docker Compose. Your online activities are now protected by strong encryption and your IP address is hidden, ensuring your privacy and security.
